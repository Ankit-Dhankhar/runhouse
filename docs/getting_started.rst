Setup
====================================

Installation
------------------------------------

You can install ``runhouse`` with pip

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install runhouse


Account
------------------------------------
Before using Runhouse, we recommend creating an `account <https://api.run.house/>`_.

.. note::
    Creating an account is not required, but doing so will allow you to manage and share your
    resources with other users. For more information on what data we collect and how we use it, see
    our :ref:`Data Policy`.


Once you have an account, you can login with the token you received via the CLI:

.. code-block:: console

     $ runhouse login


.. note::
    Runhouse currently supports three major cloud providers: AWS, Azure, and GCP.
    When logging in, you will be prompted to sync each of your configured cloud providers.


Your token, along with other initial convenient defaults, will automatically be saved to your local
Runhouse config :code:`(~/.rh/config.yaml)`.

.. code-block:: yaml

    api_server_url: https://api.run.house  # Runhouse server.
    default_folder: /default  # Default folder name.
    default_provider: aws  # gcp, azure also supported (if configured locally).
    use_local_configs:
        - local # use local configs instead of whatever may be saved on Runhouse server.
    use_rns:
        - rns # save config on Runhouse server.
    use_spot: false # use spot instances (currently only supported in aws).
    username: {username}  # Created during account setup.
    token: {token} # Generated by Runhouse.

.. tip::

      Run the :code:`sky check` command to see which cloud providers you have enabled locally.
      Runhouse uses `SkyPilot <https://skypilot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_ to manage the
      provisioning of clusters.
